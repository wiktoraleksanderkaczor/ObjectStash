ObjectStash is a serverless distribution-capable database, caching, and FUSE layer self-contained package.

What can it do:
- It can act like a filesystem, mounted wherever needed for interfacing with legacy applications. 
- It is also a storage client abstraction option; cloud, memory block or API.
- It can run a serverless multi-paradigm database on any storage client with online compute capabilities.
- It allows masterless peer-to-peer coordination for different distribution strategies.
- All of this with the ability to cache, replicate and shard as desired on any of the storage clients.
