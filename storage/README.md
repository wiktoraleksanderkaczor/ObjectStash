This module covers functionality for file manipulation and capability statements of storage clients by various mediums.

This is split into the following structure:
- interface (define class properties for valid implementation)
- superclass (shared implementation details for above)
- models (pydantic compatible data models)

Finally, {interface}/(implementations) with each implementation inheriting from the interface or superclass
